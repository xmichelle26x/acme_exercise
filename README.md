# Acme
The company ACME offers their employees the flexibility to work the hours they want. They will pay for the hours worked based on the day of the week and time of day, according to the following table:

Monday - Friday

00:01 - 09:00 25 USD

09:01 - 18:00 15 USD

18:01 - 00:00 20 USD

Saturday and Sunday

00:01 - 09:00 30 USD

09:01 - 18:00 20 USD

18:01 - 00:00 25 USD

The goal of this exercise is to calculate the total that the company has to pay an employee, based on the hours they worked and the times during which they worked. The following abbreviations will be used for entering data:

MO: Monday

TU: Tuesday

WE: Wednesday

TH: Thursday

FR: Friday

SA: Saturday

SU: Sunday

Input: the name of an employee and the schedule they worked, indicating the time and hours. This should be a .txt file with at least five sets of data. You can include the data from our two examples below.

Output: indicate how much the employee has to be paid

For example:

Case 1:

INPUT

RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT:

The amount to pay RENE is: 215 USD

Case 2:

INPUT

ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT:

The amount to pay ASTRID is: 85 USD


# Solution 

For the solution I used the single responsibility principle in the functions. I stored the schedule and the amount to pay in dictionaries to have this infomation together, I split time to calculate the end time minus the initial time, this way the result is the hours worked. With this and the dictionary we can now have the worked hours times the price per worked hours.
